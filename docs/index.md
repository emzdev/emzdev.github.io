Game Development notes, guides and documentation with a focus on Unreal Engine.

!!! info annotate "About"

	This is where I document my personal **notes** related to **game development**, with a focus 
	on **Unreal Engine**.  

	I tend to cover topics that I didn't find much information about, and had to figure out by myself. 
	I also aim to cover some frequently asked topics in the form of **guides** to contribute to the gamedev community, 
	and to have an easier time to onboard people that I work with.

	Feel free to take a look around, maybe you'll find something useful.
