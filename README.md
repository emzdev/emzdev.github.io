Game Development notes, guides and documentation with a focus on Unreal Engine 5

# About

This is a place where I document my personal **notes** and **findings** related to **game development**, with a focus on **Unreal Engine 5**.

I tend to cover topics that I didn't find much information about during my career, and had to figure out by myself. I also aim to cover some frequently asked topics in the form of **guides**, so I can more easily onboard people that I work with.

Feel free to take a look around, maybe you'll find something useful.
